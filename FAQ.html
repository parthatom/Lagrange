	<p class='question'><b>Q: Do I need to go through the works of the professor I plan on working with?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> Yes, definitely. It'll be easier to convey your interest in their work if you're already familiar with some of it. That said, you don't have to read a lot of papers, reading one is enough. Abstracts would also do, but I'd suggest going through the entire paper.</p>

	<p class='question'><b>Q: How do you get a research intern when you don't have any research experience?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> The best method is to get some research at your home institution first. However, getting your first research experience outside is also very common. In either case, the process of applying is the same. So apply to both simultaneously.
